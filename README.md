## Hi, I'm Annabel 👋
<img src="eldoradoCanyonn.jpeg" width="200" />

I am a senior undergraduate at the University of Washington majoring in Applied Mathematics: Data Science with a minor in Oceanography. I am currently working on deep learning based smoke detection in collaboration with NOAA Global Systems Laboratory, and previously worked on mapping ocean energetics at the UW School of Oceanography. 

My research interests include analyzing large geospatial datasets and developing machine learning workflows for gaining environmental insights in application areas like 
- wildfires 🔥
- extreme weather events ⛈️
- changes in food systems 🌾.

In my free time, you can find me biking 🚲, taking care of my 2 cats 🐈🐈‍⬛, cooking 🥘, and trying to beat Seattle's grey weather with indoor hydroponic farming 🌱.
