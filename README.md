## Hi, I'm Annabel 👋
<img src="eldoradoCanyonn.jpeg" width="200" />

I am a PhD student at Boston University’s Faculty of Computing and Data Sciences, working with Professor Elizabeth Barnes. I am interested in understanding how machine learning models learn to predict extreme weather events. 
  
Previously, I worked on detecting wildfire smoke from satellite imagery with ensemble deep learning at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as using statistical methods to analyze global subsurface ocean observations at the University of Washington.

In my free time, you can find me biking 🚲, taking care of my 2 cats 🐈🐈‍⬛, and cooking 🥘.

Reach me at `wade` at `bu` dot `edu`!
